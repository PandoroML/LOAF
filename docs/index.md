# Welcome to LOAF (Local Observations and Atmospheric Forecasting)

LOAF generates hyperlocal weather forecasts for locations without nearby weather stations by combining:

Regional forecast models (NOAA GFS, HRRR, ERA5)
Sparse local weather station observations
Multi-modal transformer architecture for spatial-temporal fusion
Built on research from MIT Earth Intelligence Lab:
